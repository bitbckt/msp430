DESCRIPTION

  This package serves as a template for building firmware in C,
  intended for execution on Texas Instrument MSP430 devices.

REQUIREMENTS

  Everything requires a C compiler to build and expects an ISO C99 or
  later C compiler and libraries with support for the MSP line of
  devices.

  To build firmware using this project, you will need CMake 3.1 or
  later.

BUILDING

  You can build the example with:

      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      make

  Pass -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<PATH> to cmake to search for a toolchain
  installation at <PATH>.
